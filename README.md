# **FoodVision** 🍔🍕🍰  
## Scalable Food Image Classification with TensorFlow, Flask, and Node.js

---

### **Overview**
FoodVision is a full-stack food image classification application designed for scalability, clean code separation, and production efficiency. The project leverages a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** built with TensorFlow to predict food categories from images. 

To showcase industry-standard architecture, the application adopts a **microservices approach**:
1. **Flask (Python)**: Serves the TensorFlow-trained model for image predictions.
2. **Node.js/Express**: Manages API routing, user requests, and communication with the Flask model server.
3. **(Optional) React.js Frontend**: Allows users to upload images, visualize predictions, and interact with the backend seamlessly.

### **Features** 🚀

- **State-of-the-Art CNN Model**: A trained TensorFlow model for food classification using the **Food-101 dataset**.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Separation of concerns using a Flask model server and a Node.js API server.
- **Scalable & Efficient**: Designed to handle high volumes of requests and easily scale with additional servers or containers.
- **Clean Code Separation**: Well-organized Python and Node.js codebases for easy maintenance and debugging.
- **RESTful APIs**: Interaction between components happens through clean, standardized RESTful endpoints.
- **Modern Tech Stack**:
  - **Backend**: Flask, Node.js, Express, TensorFlow
  - **Frontend** (Optional): React.js
- **Production-Ready Design**: Deployment-friendly structure for cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Heroku**, or **Docker**.
